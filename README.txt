HTML Requirements
Your HTML website must meet the minimum requirements listed below:

• ||DONE|| Should contain at least one html page (You could include multiple pages: this is strongly recommended)
• ||DONE|| Write all markup with strict HTML syntax with an opening <> and a closing tag </> or use self-closing as necessary < />.
• ||DONE|| There should be block elements such as <p> and headings <h1>, <h2>, etc.
• ||DONE|| There should be inline elements such as <a> <i>, <strong>, etc.
• ||Not Doing|| If you are making a single page site, use an ordered or unordered list to make a table of contents with links to specific sections
    of the same page using the id attribute and the <a> element. For example, if the user clicks on a list item called "Section 3"
    in the table of contents, the browser should take the user directly to that section of the webpage.
• ||DONE|| If you are making a site with multiple pages, create a list menu that links to the other pages of your site using the list element
    and the <a> element. See the example on page 383 of the HTML&CSS book.
• ||DONE|| The page should include at least one “absolute” URL linking to an external website.
• ||DONE WITH FORM|| The page should include an email link to your uWaterloo email using the mailto: element (although we would never use mailto in a
    production site, as it invites spam).
• ||DONE|| You should include at least one image (JPG, PNG, or GIF), preferably made by you. If you take images for other sources, make sure
    to credit the image and the source.
• ||DONE|| All img elements should include src, width, height, and alt attributes with appropriate values.
• ||DONE|| The page should include a small table describing some types of information using HTML.

• Adding a form is optional, but recommended.

CSS Requirements
Your website must meet these minimal CSS requirements:

• ||DONE|| Create an external style sheet (.css document) with at least eight different CSS rule sets (A CSS rule-set consists of a
    selector and a declaration block: The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.)
• ||DONE|| Your style rules should specify font family and font size for paragraph and heading text.
• ||DONE|| Your style rules should specify link states including link, visited, hover, and active.
• ||DONE|| Your style rules should specify margins, padding, and/or borders
• ||DONE|| You should specify either a background image or background color for your pages.
• ||DONE|| Use the float property for positioning and layout on your webpage.
• ||DONE|| Major sections of the page should be grouped together by <div>. The <div> tag is used to group HTML block-elements to format them with CSS.
• ||DONE|| Style your HTML table using CSS to make it visually appealing.
