    <div class="about-head">So who is this guy Caden?</div>
    <div class="about-subhead">Hey, I'm a student from Ontario, Canada trying to broaden my skills and experiences in design.</div>
    <div class="about-subhead">What truly makes media important is that it communicates ideas. It can express messages that move people to take action. They can understand the meaning and find the beauty in it, and with that, the emotions that make something so memorable. This is what draws me to digital arts, the importance of effective communication in this world, and the impact it can have on others.</div>
    <div class="about-subhead">What I know.</div>
    <div class="about-subhead">My goal with all the creative work I take on is to help others and be a problem solver. If someone needs something done, I will be on-board to collaborate, understand, and suggest the next move, regardless if I am a part of that picture. Providing high-quality work that people need is always the next thing Iâ€™m working towards. So if you're interested in my work or just want to shoot me a message, I'm always open!</div>
