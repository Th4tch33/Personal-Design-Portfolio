    <div class="about-head">So who is this guy Caden?</div>
    <div class="about-subhead">I'm a student from Ontario, Canada working to broaden my skills and experiences in as many mediums of design. Essentially, I'll take on any project that I can provide quality work while also learning along the way.</div>
    <div class="about-subhead">My goal with all the creative work I take on is to help others and be a problem solver. If someone needs something done, I will be on-board to collaborate, understand, and suggest the next move, regardless if I am a part of that picture. Providing high-quality work that people need is always the next thing Iâ€™m working towards. So if you're interested in my work or just want to shoot me a message, I'm always open!</div>
