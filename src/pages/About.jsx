            <p>
              <b>Hey!</b> I'm Caden, a digital art student exploring the need
              for good design in our world and understanding how to apply it at
              the highest level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the last few years, it's been amazing coming across so much
              professional work that is practically useful and visually
              stunning. These types of work have expanded what I thought the
              design could be and continue to fuel my eagerness to learn. In the
              future, I hope to move people worldwide with meaningful messages
              that also look pretty.
            </p>
